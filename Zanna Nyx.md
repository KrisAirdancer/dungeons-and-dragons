### Cantrips

<details open><summary><strong>Light</strong></summary><br>

> **School**: Evocation<br>
> **Level**: Cantrip<br>
> **Casting Time**: 1 action<br>
> **Range**: Touch<br>
> **Components**: V, M<br>
> **Duration**: 1 hr.<br>

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

> **Level**: Cantrip<br>
> **Casting Time**: 1 action<br>
> **Range**: 30 ft.<br>
> **Components**: V, S<br>
> **Duration**: 1 min.<br>

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

### Level 1

<details open><summary><strong>Burning Hands</strong></summary><br>

> **Level**: 1st<br>
> **Casting Time**: 1 action<br>
> **Range**: Self (15-foot cone)<br>
> **Components**: V, S<br>
> **Duration**: Instantaneous<br>

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
