<p>
    You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

&gt; 
&gt; The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
&gt; 
&gt; At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

&gt; 
&gt; At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

&gt; <strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous<br>

&gt; You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
&gt; 
&gt; If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

<details><summary><strong>Mage Armor</strong></summary><br>

&gt; <strong>School</strong>: Abjuration<br>
&gt; <strong>Level</strong>: 1st<br>
&gt; <strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action<br>
&gt; <strong>Range</strong>: Touch<br>
&gt; <strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)<br>
&gt; <strong>Duration</strong>: 8 hrs.<br>

<details><summary><strong>Sleep</strong></summary><br>

&gt; <strong>School</strong>: Enchantment<br>
&gt; <strong>Level</strong>: 1st<br>
&gt; <strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action<br>
&gt; <strong>Range</strong>: 90 ft.<br>
&gt; <strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)<br>
&gt; <strong>Duration</strong>: 1 min.<br>

&gt; This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
&gt; 
&gt; Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
&gt; 
&gt; Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.
&gt; 
&gt; At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.

<details><summary><strong>Unseen Servant</strong></summary><br>

&gt; <strong>School</strong>: Conjuration<br>
&gt; <strong>Level</strong>: 1st<br>
&gt; <strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action<br>
&gt; <strong>Range</strong>: 60 ft.<br>
&gt; <strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of string and of wood)<br>
&gt; <strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hr.<br>

&gt; This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
&gt; 
&gt; Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
&gt; 
&gt; If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
