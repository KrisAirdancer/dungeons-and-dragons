## **The Kingdom of Agrifell**

Agrifell is a large kingdom bordered to the North by The Snowy Mountains, to the Southwest by the White Sea, and to the Southeast by the Black Sea - so named for the white and black sand that covers their beaches, respectively.

- Iron Hills (Just south of The Snowy Mountains)
- Oakhurst (East)
- The Golden Hills (Central & Southwest)

    - Largely isolated from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city, The Governor's District, also known as "The Estates," is home to many wealthy merchants, nobles, and other prominent figures. The homes here are particularly large and the City Guard tends to harass anyone that wanders into the area that doesn't belong.
  - **The East District**

### **The Snowy Mountains**

- The mountain range that separates Agrifell from the kingdom to the north that is perpetually covered in snow and guaranteed to give any traveler a hard time with bad weather. The dwarves of the Iron Hills mine the mountains.

## **Economics**

The economies of Agrifell follow a simple structure.
- Each city and town is ruled by a Noble (towns) or Governor (city).
- The Noble/Governor and their advisors/council manage the affairs of the city.
- Each city has dominion over some arbitrary, and often disputed, area of land around it.
  - Within this dominion, each city and town implements various means with which to raise funds for city projects.
    - For example: Silvergate and Goldcreste, have no taxation on income, and instead taxes the sale of goods, while Bracewater simply implements an income tax system.
  - Nobles manage the details of their own townships and ensure that they are productive and profitable.
  - Larger cities provide protection to the smaller cities and towns around them in exchange for some form of payment. This structure is being continually negotiated by Nobles and Governors.
  - Cities and towns often own much of the land around them and use this as another revenue source by leasing it out to farmers and other individuals/groups.
- Small towns near larger cities often own a swath of land outside their borders, but that land is entirely surrounded - an island - by lands owned by the larger neighboring city.
