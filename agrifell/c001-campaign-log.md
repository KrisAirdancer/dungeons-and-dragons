## Quest 1
- Party talked to people in Silvergate about the rumors that people had gone missing on the South Road between Goldcrest and Silvergate.

- While traveling North on the South Road, the party encountered people who told them that most of the disappearances had occurred around a group of towns: Green Run, Middleburry, and Basalt, Northwest off of the South Road.
- The party spoke to several people in Green Run and Middleburry before deciding to travel into the forest at night to search for clues.
