**Notes**
- The party resumed play immediately after defeating the skeletons fighting the cultists in the forest.
  - After the fight, the party realized that Ea was missing.
- The party followed the drag marks in the mud until they came across a pin with a raven head on it in the mud.
  - Upon finding the pin, the two cultists with the party attempted, unsuccessfully and somewhat humorously, to knock out Niko and Mara.
  - That party quickly disarmed and captured the two cultists, binding their hands and feet with rope.
  - The cultists, after some intimidation, revealed that they had planned to sacrifice the party to the Raven Queen.
- After following the drag marks a bit longer, the party came up parallel with a dark white-grey fog out of which arms and ghastly faces would occasionally appear.
  - Niko recalled from his studies that these types of fogs generally accompany strong evil/dark forces.
  - The party agreed that they would need to enter the fog at some point to put a stop to the undead, but now was not the time to do so.
- After another short walk following the drag marks North, the party came across a cultist camp.
  - After investigating the camp, it was clear that this was a camp of cultists of the the same sort that the party had traveling with them. The party also discovered several prisoners tied to a tree on the edge of camp near the campfire - hands bound and heads covered with sacks.
  -  Mara snuck to the East side of the camp and used her Ki to generate a gust of wind which smothered and extinguished the campfire in the camp.
  - Niko knocked the two cultists out, then he and Akra took the cultists cloaks and snuck up to the prisoners on the edge of the camp and cut their hands free.
  - Akra then entered the camp after the cultist leader, Raff Quill, brought out an amulet that threw light over the camp.
  - After a moment of tense bluffing, Akra was able to convince the group that she was a member of the Cult of the Raven and had come to join them in their efforts.
  - Raff Quill, the cult leader, introduces himself and a trusted advisor Tanner Ginn.
    - They explain that they are seeking to aid the Raven Queen take her earthy form by providing her with sustenance by way of sacrifices. They seek to take the next group of sacrifices into the fog in the morning to sacrifice them directly to the Raven Queen's incomplete form. They plan to use an amulet that they have obtained to keep the undead away during their journey.
    - After this, they depart.
- The party deliberates for some time, then the cultists go to bed for the night. Akra joins them in one of their tents.
- Mara and Niko then free the captives, Ea among them, and Ea turns into a mouse to sneak into the cultist tents and retrieve Akra.
- The party makes their way back to Middleburry. Along the way, they discover that one of the prisoners, Hannah Bris, is the missing wife of John Bris in Middleburry and that the other prisoner is, David Chath, a small time merchant who trades in wood products. David was accosted on the road while trying to repair a wheel on his wagon. The party still has the two cultists that accosted them in tow.
- The party stops at the Bris' house to return Hannah home. John is grateful and tells them that he will come up with some kind of reward if they return the following day. He also says that there will need to be a council meeting on this matter and that will likely take place the following morning. He will round the council members up.
- After stopping at the Bris' house, the party, the two prisoners, and David Chath all head to the Middleburry Inn to spend the night.
  - The innkeep, after hearing their story, gives them free room and board for the night.
  - The prisoners get tied up in the room.

## Quest 1 (May 31, 2023)
- The Party talked to people in Silvergate about the rumors that people had gone missing on the South Road between Goldcrest and Silvergate.
  - They were told of the coming of the “end of the world” by the Cult of the Raven that will bring an end to all existence, and of a “rebirth” of the world by the Church of Moradin that will cleanse all evils from the world.
- While traveling North on the South Road, the party encountered people who told them that most of the disappearances had occurred around a group of towns: Green Run, Middleburry, and Basalt, Northwest off of the South Road.
- The party spoke to several people in Green Run and Middleburry before deciding to travel into the forest at night to search for clues.
- In the forest, the party found two poorly armed Cultists fighting a few skeletons.
  - The party quickly dispatched the skeletons.
- However, during the fight, Ea was accosted from behind by strange white creatures and pulled into the darkness.
- The party left off standing in the rainy muddy forest with the two cultists.
