As always, if I missed anything, let me know or make a PR.

## Quest 4 (July 8, 2023)

**Locations**
- Red Creek Stronghold
- White River Stronghold
  - A small fortress built into the side of a hill next to the White River.
- Middleburry

**NPCs**
- Oscar Ward - Middleburry castle librarian
- Liam Ort - Owner & Inkeep of the Middleburry Inn

**Items**
- A page torn from a book that depicts an urn drawn with ghostly figures pouring out of it and into the hands of the Demon Lord Razon. The holder of the urn is surrounded by dead bodies.
  - Found in the White River Stronghold on a table near the obelisk.
- A small jar (8 inches tall, 4 inches wide) with a green gelatinous cube inside that appears to dissolve anything you feed it.

**Summary**
- The party began by doing some research into how to destroy the obelisk in the Red Creek Stronghold.
  - After searching the Middleburry library, they discovered that they could probably just smash it.
- The party returned to the Red Creek Stronghold and fired an arrow at the obelisk there. It broke the obelisk and the fog was lifted. Many undead could be seen dead on the ground in the surrounding area after the fog faded.
- The party then traveled to the edge of the fog in the North, just South of the White River Stronghold. Here, they spent an uneventful night around the fire before venturing into the fog once again.
- Upon reaching the White River Stronghold, the party discovered a room full of ghouls (different from the undead and skeletons walking around).
- After a fight with 4 ghouls wherein Ea and Mara took some nasty hits from the ghouls' claws, the party explored the room.
- In the room they found another obelisk, which they quickly dispatched with another arrow from Niko's crossbow. The fog in the area was lifted and more undead could be found, now dead, lying about.
- Searching the room revealed another page torn from a book and a jar with a tiny green gelatinous cube in it.
- At this point, the party returned to the Middleburry Inn.

## Quest 3 (July 3, 2023)

**Locations**
- Middleburry
  - A small town of Tudor and thatched roof houses surrounded by forest. A small castle, the Middleburry Castle, stands on a hill in West Middleburry.
- The Cultist's Camp
  - A now deserted campsite in the woods a few miles East of Middleburry.
- Red Creek Stronghold
  - A small fortress of only two stories and the ramparts that has long since been abandoned.
  - The basement contained some wooden tables covered in illegible notes and a few pages torn from a book depicting dark magic; an obsidian obelisk floating in the corner; and a very angry giant bear skeleton.

- Parker Calliwell - Three Towns Council Hand

**Items**
- Pages torn from a book found in the Red Creek Stronghold:
  - One page contains an image depicting a dark cloaked figure connected to three black floating obelisks via a dark energy. In front of the obelisks are many white ghastly bodies rising from the dead.
  - The other page depicts a group of black-cloaked worshipers bowed before a great red winged demon. White spirits are being drawn from their bodies toward the demon who, himself, is casting a spell of silvery light onto the worshipers. Above the image are the words: "Endless life for those who follow the great Lord Razon"
- A small stone tablet with a map on one side from John Bris.
  - It appears to be showing the way from Basalt to some location Northwest of the town marked by a worn set of arched lines.
  - John says he tracked the route to an set of half-buried obelisks with strange symbols on them. He wasn't able to find anything himself, but hopes the party might be able to.

**Summary**
- The party was met in the morning by John Bris in the Middleburry Inn where the party spent the night.
  - He gifted them a stone tablet with a map on the back.
- The party then attended the council meeting, also held in the Middleburry Inn.
  - The council offered the party assistance in their quest to get rid of the undead.
    - The party requested some room and board and the council obliged.
  - They don't have anything to reward the party with currently since the undead have driven business off from the town and they've been relying on their nearly depleted reserve gold to sustain themselves.
  - The party handed the two cultists in their tow off to the town militia to be imprisoned in the Middleburry jail.
- The party took a couple of Militia Men to the site of the cultist camp and discovered that the camp had been hastily deserted and the body of Raff Quill had been taken.
- The party was shown a map in the Middleburry Castle Library. It showed the locations of,
  - The Red Creek Stronghold
  - The White River Fortress (8 miles North)
  - Stonewood Watch (50-60 miles Northwest)
    - Best accessed from the South Road (only a few miles off the West side of the road)
  - The East Tower (10 miles Southeast)
  - Stonehold (10 miles South)
- The party sent Niko into the fog, tied to a rope for easy recall, along with the amulet of light.
  - The fog cleared around him and kept the undead at bay as he walked.
  - This venture lasted only a minute or so before the undead took hold of the rope and started pulling Niko around.
  - The party pulled Niko and three undead out of the fog and quickly vanquished the three undead.
- After the close call, the party traveled as a group into the fog until they reached the Red River Stronghold.
  - Here, they attempted to clear out the building, but were unsuccessful as they had nothing to bar the front door with and undead continued to enter.
  - Upon searching the basement, the party discovered a very angry giant bear skeleton that got stuck at the bottom of the stairwell. After a quick discussion about what to do, Ea cast a Moonlight spell that ended up disintegrating the bones of the undead bear, causing it to collapse into a pile.
  - In the basement, the party discovered some tables covered in unintelligible notes and a couple of pages ripped from a book (see Items above) and a 2-3 foot tall shard of obsidion-like stone floating in the corner emitting a silvery white glow and a black fog that sunk to the ground around it.
  - Niko and Mara were able to put their heads together and recall that they'd learned in their studies about a dark spell that can be cast using shards of obsidian from Shadowfell, the Plane of Shadow, to create obelisks that can be used by the caster to amplify their power and control large numbers of the undead.
- After another deliberation, the party decided to head back to Middleburry to determine the best way to handle the obelisk that they believed to be the thing that is animating the dead.
- By the time the party returned to Middleburry, it was past dusk and they turned in for the night at the Middleburry Inn.

**Summary**
- The party resumed play immediately after defeating the skeletons fighting the cultists in the forest.
  - After the fight, the party realized that Ea was missing.
- The party followed the drag marks in the mud until they came across a pin with a raven head on it in the mud.
  - Upon finding the pin, the two cultists with the party attempted, unsuccessfully and somewhat humorously, to knock out Niko and Mara.
  - That party quickly disarmed and captured the two cultists, binding their hands and feet with rope.
  - The cultists, after some intimidation, revealed that they had planned to sacrifice the party to the Raven Queen.
- After following the drag marks a bit longer, the party came up parallel with a dark white-grey fog out of which arms and ghastly faces would occasionally appear.
  - Niko recalled from his studies that these types of fogs generally accompany strong evil/dark forces.
  - The party agreed that they would need to enter the fog at some point to put a stop to the undead, but now was not the time to do so.
- After another short walk following the drag marks North, the party came across a cultist camp.
  - After investigating the camp, it was clear that this was a camp of cultists of the the same sort that the party had traveling with them. The party also discovered several prisoners tied to a tree on the edge of camp near the campfire - hands bound and heads covered with sacks.
  -  Mara snuck to the East side of the camp and used her Ki to generate a gust of wind which smothered and extinguished the campfire in the camp.
  - Niko knocked the two cultists out, then he and Akra took the cultists cloaks and snuck up to the prisoners on the edge of the camp and cut their hands free.
  - Akra then entered the camp after the cultist leader, Raff Quill, brought out an amulet that threw light over the camp.
  - After a moment of tense bluffing, Akra was able to convince the group that she was a member of the Cult of the Raven and had come to join them in their efforts.
  - Raff Quill, the cult leader, introduces himself and a trusted advisor Tanner Ginn.
    - They explain that they are seeking to aid the Raven Queen take her earthy form by providing her with sustenance by way of sacrifices. They seek to take the next group of sacrifices into the fog in the morning to sacrifice them directly to the Raven Queen's incomplete form. They plan to use an amulet that they have obtained to keep the undead away during their journey.
    - After this, they depart.
- The party deliberates for some time, then the cultists go to bed for the night. Akra joins them in one of their tents.
- Mara and Niko then free the captives, Ea among them, and Ea turns into a mouse to sneak into the cultist tents and retrieve Akra.
- The party makes their way back to Middleburry. Along the way, they discover that one of the prisoners, Hannah Bris, is the missing wife of John Bris in Middleburry and that the other prisoner is, David Chath, a small time merchant who trades in wood products. David was accosted on the road while trying to repair a wheel on his wagon. The party still has the two cultists that accosted them in tow.
- The party stops at the Bris' house to return Hannah home. John is grateful and tells them that he will come up with some kind of reward if they return the following day. He also says that there will need to be a council meeting on this matter and that will likely take place the following morning. He will round the council members up.
- After stopping at the Bris' house, the party, the two prisoners, and David Chath all head to the Middleburry Inn to spend the night.
  - The innkeep, after hearing their story, gives them free room and board for the night.
  - The prisoners get tied up in the room.

## Quest 1 (May 31, 2023)
- The Party talked to people in Silvergate about the rumors that people had gone missing on the South Road between Goldcrest and Silvergate.
  - They were told of the coming of the “end of the world” by the Cult of the Raven that will bring an end to all existence, and of a “rebirth” of the world by the Church of Moradin that will cleanse all evils from the world.
- While traveling North on the South Road, the party encountered people who told them that most of the disappearances had occurred around a group of towns: Green Run, Middleburry, and Basalt, Northwest off of the South Road.
