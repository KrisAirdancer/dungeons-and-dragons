## Weapons & Combat

- **Finesse** (PHB 147):
  - When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- **Versitile** (PHB 147):
  - This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property - the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

## Leveling

- **Character Level vs Class Level**:
  - For the most part character level == class level.
  - Unless you are multiclassing, these two levels should be the same.

## Spellcasting - Wizards

- **Number of Prepared Spells**:
  - You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook **equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level** (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
  - For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

## Other

- **Tools** (PHB 154):
  - A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.
