# D&D FAQ & Quick Reference Sheet

## Weapons & Combat

- **Finesse** (PHB 147):
  - When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- **Versitile** (PHB 147):
  - This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property - the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

## Other

- **Tools** (PHB 154):
  - A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.
