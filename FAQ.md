What is the Attack Bonus/Modifier? How is it calculated? [Reference][5e]

<details><summary>A:</summary>

The Attack Bonus/Modifier is added to the Attack Roll (not the Damage Roll) - Melee Attacks with proficient weapons: ATK Mod = STR Mod + Proficiency Bonus- Melee Attacks with weapons with Finesse*: ATK Mod = STR Mod OR DEX Mod + Proficiency Bonus - Ranged Weapon Attacks: ATK Mod = DEX Mod + Proficiency Bonues - Thrown Weapon Attacks: ATK Mod = Calculated the same way as Melee Attacks (above) (if weapon has Finesse, can use DEX instead of STR) - Spell Attacks: ATK Mod = Spellcasting Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (spellcasters always have proficiency in making spell attacks - aka. casting spells)

*Finesse Property: A property of the weapon, not a feat/ability of the PC/NPC. https://www.fandomspot.com/dnd-attack-bonus/

</details><br>

What is a Damage Modifier and how is it cacluated?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

</details><br>

What is a Critical Hit? When does it occur?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

A Critical Hit, or Crit, occurs when a 20 is rolled on a d20 (excluding modifiers to the roll) for an attack roll. When this happens, the attack succeeds regardless of the AC of the target and the Damage Die is rolled twice (both rolls are summed) instead of once (the ATK Modifiers are still added to the roll).

Note: This also applies to Difficulty Checks (not just combat/attack rolls). If a 20 is rolled, the check succeeds regardless of the DC. Note: For weapons with plural Damage Die (2xd8), you double the roll. So for 2xd8, you would roll 4xd8.

Spellcasting [Reference]

<details><summary>A:</summary>

"When a spell is cast, one spell slot from the spells level or higher is spent. Spell slots are restored during Long Rests. Cantrips don't expend spell slots. Ritual Spells take 10 minutes longer to cast than they would otherwise, but don't expend a spell slot. In order to cast a spell, the character must 1) know the spell, 2) have the spell prepared, 3) have the appropriate spell slot to expend for that spell, and 4) have the components (material, somatic, or verbal) required by the spell. Spell slots of a higher level may be used to cast spells of lower level. All spells require time to cast. Most just require an action, but others have different time requirements. Spell Duration is the amount of time that the effects of a spell are effective for. For spells that require concentration, you can still move, take actions, and attack without having to make a check to keep your concentration (without breaking concentration), but if you cast another spell that requires concentration, your concentration for the first spell will be broken. If you are incapacitated or killed, your concentration is broken. If you take damage, you must make a constitution save to maintain concentraiton - the DC for this is equal to 10 or half the damage you took, whichever is higher. When a spell is cast on another creature, one of two things happens. Either 1) the target creature has to make a Spell Saving Throw or 2) the caster will have to make a Spell Attack. Making a Spell Attack: Roll a d20 and add your Spell Attack Bonus. Then, compare the final value to the AC of the target creature. Making a Spell Saving Throw: The details of the Saving Throw for each spell are outlined in the spell's description. But, for all spells, if the target fails the Saving Throw (fails to overcome the caster's Spell Save DC), they are hit with the spell. Spell Attack Bonus = Spellcasting Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus Spellcasting Ability Modifier = WIS Mod for Wizards, Clarics, Druids, and Rangers; CHA Mod for Bard, Paladins, and Sorcerers (PHB 178-179). Spell Save DC = 8 + Spellcasting Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus + Other Modifiers"

An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Basic Rules for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) Fifth Edition (5e) - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com)

</details><br>

What is the range of Improvised Thrown Weapons?

20/60 feet

<details><summary>A:</summary>

Basic Rules for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) Fifth Edition (5e) - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com)

</details><br>

When can an Improvised Weapon be treated as a normal weapon?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

When the improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon. In this case, use the weapon stats for the real weapon (instead of the improvised weapon stats) - if the player has proviciency in the real weapon, that is.

"Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. Basic Rules for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) Fifth Edition (5e) - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com)"

</details><br>

How do you read range numbers for ranged weapons? Ex. What does 80/320 mean?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

For X/Y, X is the Normal Range AND Y is the Maximum Range

"- Attacks made between 6-X feet are made normally. - Attacks made between 81-320 feet are made with Disadvantage. - Attacks made at > 320 feet are impossible - the weapon just can't throw a projectile that far."

What does it mean to have Advantage/Disadvantage?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

If you have Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll, Roll 2d20, - If you have Advantage, use the higher of the two rolls - If you have Disadvantage, use the lower of the two rolls

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

</details><br>

What happens if a PCs Hit Points drop to or below zero?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

One of two things, 1) They fall unconcious OR 2) They die outright When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points. From here, if you are unconcious, you must make a Death Saving Throw on each of your turns. After three successes, you become Stable. After three failures, you die.

PHB 197 Basic Rules for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) Fifth Edition (5e) - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com)

</details><br>

What is a Death Saving Throw? How do they work?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

"Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable."

PHB 197 Basic Rules for Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) Fifth Edition (5e) - D&D Beyond (dndbeyond.com)

</details><br>

How is Unconciousness broken?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

"For unconcious caused by deadly force, - By regaining any amount of Hit Points. For unconcious by non-deadly force, - Whatever the DM feels is reasonable (I think the below is good - for now). - PC either rolls a Natural 20 on a throw to wake up, or succeeds on 3 ""Unconciousness Saving Throws"" (Success = same as Death Saving Throw)"

Note: There are no rules in the book for getting knocked out via non-deadly force. House-rules this one.

</details><br>

How can a creature with 0 Hit Points be stabilized?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

1) They can stabilize themself via the rules for Death Saving Throws OR 2) Another creature can adminsiter first aid, which requires that they succeed on a DC 10 Medicine (WIS) check

Stabilized creatures no longer make Death Saving Throws, but do remain unconcious and do still have 0 Hit Points.

</details><br>

What is a Saving Throw?

<details><summary>A:</summary>

A Saving Throw - also called a Save - represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a diseas, or a similar threat.
