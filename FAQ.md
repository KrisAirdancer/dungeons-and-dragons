## Weapons & Combat

- **Finesse** (PHB 147):
  - When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- **Versitile** (PHB 147):
  - This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property - the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

## Leveling

- **Character Level vs Class Level**:
  - For the most part character level == class level.
  - Unless you are multiclassing, these two levels should be the same.
- **How to Level Up a Character**
  - Character level up is specified by your class.
  - Each class will specify how to increase ability scores as well as how other skills, feats, etc. change with each level.
  - Note that sometimes character race will have traits that level up as well.
  - TL;DR: Look in both your character class and character race sections of the PHB for how to level up your character.

## Spellcasting - Wizards

- **Number of Prepared Spells**:
  - You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook **equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level** (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
  - For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

- **Other**
  - Wizard Level is simply your character level.

## Spellcasting - Druids

- **Known Spells**
  - Druids know all of the spells on the Druid spell list starting at level 1.
  - Druids can only cast spells that they have prepared ahead of time.
    - The number of spells they may cast is: # prepared = WIS modifier + Druid Level
- **Other**
  - Druid Level is simply your character level.

## Spellcasting - General

- **Spellcasting/Caster Level** - The total level of your caster class.
  - For single-class characters, Caster Level == Character Level
  - For multi-classing, the caster class determines the caster level.
    - Ex. Wizard 4/Rogue 6 has a Caster Level of 4.

## Other

- **Tools** (PHB 154):
  - A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.
- **Skill Checks** (PHB 174):
  - Strength:
    - Athletics (climbing, jumping, swimming, etc.)
  - Dexterity:
    - Acrobatics (walking on ice, balance beam, walking on a rocking ship)
    - Sleigt of Hand
    - Stealth
  - Intelligence:
    - Arcana
    - History
    - Investigation
    - Nature
    - Religion
  - Wisdom:
    - Animal Handling
    - Insight
    - Medicine
    - Perception
    - Survival
  - Charisma
    - Deception
    - Intimidation
    - Persuasion
- **Alignment** [Source - RPGBot](https://rpgbot.net/dnd5/players/alignment/)
  - What is Alignment?
    - Alignment is an extremely simple two-axis system used to describe a creatures’ general “moral attitude”. While this doesn’t portray the minutae of philosophy, it can be a quick shorthand to determine how a creature might behave. For example: a lawful-good creature will generally by just, kind, and orderly, while a chaotic evil creature will often be selfish and unpredictable.
    - Alignment is descibed using the creature’s positon on each of the two axes. A creature who is lawful and evil will be described as “Lawful-Evil”. A creature who is neutral and good will be described as “Neutral-Good”. A creature who is neutral on both axes is described simply as “Neutral”, though previous editions have used the term “True Neutral”.
    - Alignment doesn’t go into more detail than that, and to some degree it’s not intended to. Intelligent creatures are complex, and there’s no way to perfectly describe a creature’s philosophical outlook in a space small enough to fit on a character sheet.
    - While alignment is listed using discting steps (lawful, neutral, chaotic. good, neutral, evil.), a creature might lean in one direction or another. Alignment is somewhat clumsy in cases where a creature doesn’t fall neatly into one category, so an evil-leaning lawful-neutral character can be difficult to describe in the broad strokes used by the Alignment system.
  - Law and Chaos
    - The first axis of Alignment is the “Law vs. Chaos” axis.
    - Creatures which are “Lawful” tend to be orderly and organized. They often value rules and structure, and therefore value systems which support those ideals: laws, traditions, systems of honor, etc. At its best, being Lawful means honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, and stability. At its worst, being Lawful means being rigid, stagnant, judgemental, and tyranical.
    - Creatures which are “Chaotic” value freedom and flexibility. They value freedom of choice, individualism, and adaptability. At its best, being Chaotic means a readiness to accept change, to explore new ideas, and to explore new ideas. At its worst, being chaotic means being disorganized, unreliable, irresponsible, and sometimes even destructive.
    - Law and Chaos are intentionally separated from Good and Evil because being lawful or chaotic aren’t inherently good or bad qualities. There are plenty of stories about heroes who you might describe as chaotic, and there are plenty of stories about villains who you might describe as lawful.
  - Good and Evil
    - The second axis of Alignment is the “Good vs. Evil” axis.
    - Creatures which are “Good” tend to be altruistic, generous, and peaceful. Good characters often give of themselves to help others.
    - Creatures which are “Evil” tend to be selfish, greedy, and sometimes even malicious. While 5th edition doesn’t specifically say so, previous editions have stated that “implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others”. The exact published definition of “evil” has changed somewhat over the game’s history, but in general evil creatures are willing to harm others in order to get what they want.
    - The good vs. evil axis is perhaps the heart of the controversy around Alignment. We’ll discuss this more below.
  - The Ten Alignments
    - The ten alignments are described below based on their descriptions in the 5th edition core rules with some elaboration based on previous editions. The Player’s Handbook contains brief descriptions of each of these alignments, but I also encourage you to read the Wikipedia entries and the entries below.
    - We’ll revisit alignments later in the article to expand on what we can do with these alignments.
    - **Lawful Good** creatures act how a “good person” is expected to act. They follow rules, respect legitimite authority, and treat others with kindness, honor, and respect.
    - **Lawful Good** has long been considered the alignment of idealistic heroes. Paladins were locked into lawful-good alignment until late in 3rd edition, and paladins have long been a beacon of moral certitude. However, characters who are lawful good are frequently seen as morally rigid and stubborn, so the alignment is often derided as “lawful stupid”.
    - **Neutral Good** creatures do their best to do what they consider “good”, but don’t cling to rules or stricture so much as Lawful Good creatures. A Neutral Good creature might still obey the law or society’s expectations most of the time, but they are not rigidly bound by them, and they view doing right thing as more valuable than obeying some strict doctrine.
    - **Chaotic Good** creatures do what they believe to be right with little regard for the opinions of others. They are guided by their own sense of good and evil rather than the prevailing opinions of society, and they do not feel bound by rules, laws, or other creatures’ expectations of behavior.
    - **Lawful Neutral** act in accordance with the law, tradition, or with some code of behavior. While this code can often be external (the law, a religious tradition, etc.), it can also be self-determined.
    - **Neutral** creatures do what seems like the best option in any given situation. These creatures might lack strong moral convictions, they might be indecisive, or they might simply be unoppinionated. Such creatures typically act based upon their momentary needs and desires rather than based on a moral philosophy.
      - Perhaps the hardest alignment to play, Neutral implies that a character either can’t, won’t, or hasn’t performed enough self-reflection to align themselves anywhere else within the Alignment system. In a party of characters who are usually not also Neutral (even if alignment is selected at random), it’s difficult to remain Neutral while your party is murder-hoboing or leading a divine crusade.
    - **Chaotic Neutral** creatures follow their whims, valuing their own freedom and self-interest above other concerns. Such creatures dislike being ordered to do things, and pay no regard for rules or other creatures’ expectations. And, while they are not always selfish to the point of harming others, they feel no compulsion to help other creatures in need.
      - Many new players fall into the trap of “Chaotic Neutral” as a universally permissive alignment. Innumerable adventurers have been made Chaotic Neutral as an excuse to murder, pillage, and rob their way through life. Remember: within the confines of the Alignment system, harming others for personal benefit (murder, robbery, etc.) is evil. There’s nothing wrong with playing an evil character, but let’s not lie to ourselves and pretend that “Stabby the Burgler-Arsonist” is Chaotic Neutral.
    - **Lawful Evil** creatures act within a code of behavior, but are otherwise self-centered. They are often tyrants, or would be if they could, seeking to use their code of behavior to advance their own interests.
    - **Neutral Evil** creatures are self-interested, and do whatever they can get away with to advance their own interestes. They might follow rules if it serves them, but they do not feel bound to do so. At the same time, they aren’t to unpredictable as Chaotic evil creatures.
    - **Chaotic Evil** creatures are motivated by arbitrary and often malicious whims. They are typically greedy and selfish, and are often violent. They give no thought to the wants or needs of other creatures, and pay no heed to rules or expectations. Such creatures will typically only bow to authority when threatened.
      - Chaotic Evil’s description has been weird since at least 3rd edition. 5e’s description starts with “creatures act with arbitrary violence”, which sounds a bit harsh. But compared to the 3rd edition entry, that’s pretty gentle. 3rd edition describes such creatures as “hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable”, and goes on to describe other evil stuff like spreading evil and chaos.
    - **Unaligned** creatures (yes, “Unaligned” is an alignment) lack the mental capacity to make philosophical judgements, and therefore don’t have an alignment. Such creatures include beasts and unintelligent undead. While these creatures may still exibit alignment-like traits (squirrels dillignetly collect and bury good; dogs might act sympathetically toward a sad or injured humanoid), these behaviors are considered less about moral judgement than they are about conditioning, and unaligned creatures lack a capacity for self-reflection which would allow them to examine the moral implications of their thoughts and behaviors.
