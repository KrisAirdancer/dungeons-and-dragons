# Dungeon Master's Notes

*Thing's I've learned as a DM

## Sticky

- "If you're spending more time prepping than your players spend playing a quest, you're spending too much time on prep." - TODO: Citation
- "Prep as little as possible." - TODO: Citation

- More Roleplaying
  - More interaction/action from DM's PCs (more conversations between Player PCs and DM PCs)
- Have DMPCs explore the world a bit too - they don't just always follow the party around like automatons.
- Players don't miss - the world get's in their way.
  - The dice aren't the players, they are the world and the circumstances.
  - The enemy dodged, a rock fell, someone moved out of the way due to something else and got lucky, etc.
  - See Reddit posts
- Better use of DMPCs to get players unstuck
  - Have the DMPCs take actions to guide the party - don't just leave the party to figure it all out for themselves.
  - Make suggestions, DMPCs can go do things to guide the party.

- Review this log before starting the quest to give a better summary of the previous quest.
- Fill out the FAQ doc with questions we had during the quest to make them fast to find the next time we need them.
- Think about character interactions a bit more before the quests.
  - This to make roleplaying better. My characters lacked depth or interest or even an obvious motivation.
- Outline the goal of each scene – brief outlines though.
  - Just write out what I hope to accomplish with each scene.
- Too much prep. Don’t do this. I’ll get better at the improv over time.
  - Generate a “hopeful storyline” that outlines the order each scene should appear in.
  - That is, prep using the LDM method, but afterward (at the bottom of the quest doc) write out the timeline that I hope the quest will follow.
  - Include the locations, in order, the clues to be found at each, the NPCs and Monsters that are there, and other basic information.
- This step should only take about 15 minutes.
- Keep better track of initiative during combat.
  - Use the “Turn Order” column in the Combat Sheet to list the order in which combatants take turns.
  - Then, sort the table by that column.
- Print out the monster/combatant summary sheets as given in the book or on D&D Beyond’s website.
  - I need to have these more easily accessible instead of in a separate tab from the combat sheet.
  - I could also put screenshots of them in the combat sheet.
- Better quest openings and motivations.
  - Need to provide better motivation for why the party is going on the quest at the when I introduce the quest.
  - Better storytelling and provide better reason/motivation for the party to be incentivized to do the quest.
- Better quests.
  - This quest was a bit bland. Not many points of interest.
  - I need to include more puzzles, and PC decision points, more roleplaying, and more tricky combat scenarios.
