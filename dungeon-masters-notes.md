# Dungeon Master's Notes

*Thing's I've learned as a DM

## Sticky

- "If you're spending more time prepping than your players spend playing a quest, you're spending too much time on prep." - Unkown
- "Prep as little as possible." - Unkown

- Combat descriptions were much better this time.
  - But could be more diverse in the descriptions of the types of attacks (mix up how the attacks happen and how the attacks are made)
- Better scene descriptions.
  - Better descriptions especially of things that can be interacted with.
  - Ex. There’s a door and it is open, descriptions while traveling, etc.
- Getting another person to play with would be a big plus.
- Give the NPCs (especially Niko) more personality.

## July 3, 2023
- Theatre of the mind combat was good.
  - A mix of maps and non-maps for combat was more immersive in some situations.
- Stories were good. Roleplay was good.
- More guidance would have been better.
  - Wasn’t sure which clue to follow first.
- Did better playing Niko in terms of roleplay and decision making with Vista (The PCs).
  - That is, the Party-NPC to PC interaction was better.
- The open world would have been good for a bigger group of players.
  - One player makes the open world system a bit harder.
  - It is easier to have more guidance as a single player.
- I personally thought it added more suspense and realism to the game to not tell the party when they killed something.
  - They get a description of what happened (the zombie collapses to the ground), but I don’t tell them that “it died.”
  - Thus, they are left wondering if they’ve finished it off or not.
  - Over the long run, they’ll get good at knowing what’s dead and what’s not, but this is an easy way to add some extra interest, realism, and suspense to the game.

- Positive Feedback
  - Fun attacks and roleplays were good.	
  - Made the roleplays back and forth and had the adversaries challenge the PCs a bit with dialogue with additional roles. But the talking back and forth even without roles was good.	
  	- Not everybody was persuaded.
  - Tying past story points in (Hannah Bris the missing wife).	
  - Sharing the map was good.	
  - Discouraging bad choices was good.	
  - Mix of theatre of the mind and visual maps was good.	
  - A mix of different things like combat and roleplay was good.	
- Negative Feedback
  - Determine when to roll vs when not to roll for success on outcomes.
    - That is, when the party or a PC (or even an NPC) is trying to do something, decide whether or not I am okay with a positive or negative outcome in terms of what will make the game the most enjoyable and make for the best story (and even what makes the most sense for the story as it is currently playing out). If I'm not okay with one of the possible outcomes of a roll, make the decision about the outcome myself and just tell them what happens. If I want the element of unpredictability in there, have them roll.
    - But make the decision of whether to roll or not and then stick with it.

## January 29, 2023
- More Roleplaying
  - More interaction/action from DM's PCs (more conversations between Player PCs and DM PCs)
- Have DMPCs explore the world a bit too - they don't just always follow the party around like automatons.
- Players don't miss - the world get's in their way.
  - The dice aren't the players, they are the world and the circumstances.
  - The enemy dodged, a rock fell, someone moved out of the way due to something else and got lucky, etc.
  - See Reddit posts
- Better use of DMPCs to get players unstuck
  - Have the DMPCs take actions to guide the party - don't just leave the party to figure it all out for themselves.
  - Make suggestions, DMPCs can go do things to guide the party.

## January 13, 2023
- Akra would like Akra to be able to use her deception skills sometime.
- Akra would like to fight some clever monsters.
  - She tried to trip the giant spider they fought with some rope.
- Better quest endings/wrap up.
- Better quest intros/hooks.

## January 2, 2023
- Review this log before starting the quest to give a better summary of the previous quest.
- Fill out the FAQ doc with questions we had during the quest to make them fast to find the next time we need them.
- Think about character interactions a bit more before the quests.
  - This to make roleplaying better. My characters lacked depth or interest or even an obvious motivation.
- Outline the goal of each scene – brief outlines though.
  - Just write out what I hope to accomplish with each scene.
- Too much prep. Don’t do this. I’ll get better at the improv over time.
  - Generate a “hopeful storyline” that outlines the order each scene should appear in.
  - That is, prep using the LDM method, but afterward (at the bottom of the quest doc) write out the timeline that I hope the quest will follow.
  - Include the locations, in order, the clues to be found at each, the NPCs and Monsters that are there, and other basic information.
- This step should only take about 15 minutes.
- Keep better track of initiative during combat.
  - Use the “Turn Order” column in the Combat Sheet to list the order in which combatants take turns.
  - Then, sort the table by that column.
- Print out the monster/combatant summary sheets as given in the book or on D&D Beyond’s website.
  - I need to have these more easily accessible instead of in a separate tab from the combat sheet.
  - I could also put screenshots of them in the combat sheet.
- Better quest openings and motivations.
  - Need to provide better motivation for why the party is going on the quest at the when I introduce the quest.
  - Better storytelling and provide better reason/motivation for the party to be incentivized to do the quest.
- Better quests.
  - This quest was a bit bland. Not many points of interest.
  - I need to include more puzzles, and PC decision points, more roleplaying, and more tricky combat scenarios.
